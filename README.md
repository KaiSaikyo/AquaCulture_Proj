# AquaCulture in Singapore
Singapore hopes to produce 30% of its own food by 2030. This includes raising fish indoors. Indoor fish farming requires the temperature of the water in the containment tanks to be consistently regulated to ensure that the fish can thrive in their habitat and develop properly. 

For this project, I have been tasked to develop a microcontroller system that can monitor and display water tank parameters such as temperature or others, regulate aeration or oxygenation automatically when oxygen level is detected to be low, notify the fish farmers via an audible tone, suitably display when the water conditions are not optimal as well as regulate treated water into the tanks, exchanging water to maintain its quality.
